# Hangman-Game

This is a South Park themed hangman game. When the user first enters the page, a random phrase (South Park character) will be chosen, to which dashes representing the letters of the character will be shown. 

On each keypress from the user, the app will check whether or not the letter belongs to the chosen phrase. 

_If So:_ The dash in place of the letter will be replaced by the associated letter, and the game will continue.

_If Not:_ No dashes will be replaced, and the amount of guesses the user has left will be decremented. 

### When the Game Ends: 
The game will end when the user has run out of allotted guesses, or when they have correctly guessed the South Park Character. 

At that point, the correct phrase will be displayed and an image of the character will be shown. 

Enjoy! :)
